        <Showcase name='Intral' role='Project Lead, Full Stack Developer'>
          Intral is the cross-platform, all-in-one mobile app designed by students, with students in mind.
          Tracking performance throughout the year, students have the ability to analyze which
          classes they're doing good in, which classes they're doing bad in, and how best to improve.
          Newly added assignments are notified to the app so that students no longer need to constantly
          stress over and check the grade book every few minutes.

          promotes active and enjoyable learning!
